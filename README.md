# Calculator-Personal-Project

The Calculator Personal Project

I started this project in the summer and aimed to build a calculator that was able to do a wide variety of calculations
as well as various other things. It is text based, but I will soon be switching to a call-number based system 
and adding compatibility for more than two numbers in a given function at once.

Here are the current capabilities of the calculator. The parentheses at the description's end envelop the call.

1. Side Trigonometry (2 sides finding the last one, which will be updated to not such a moronic (and most likely wrong) method. (sidetrigonometry, strig, sidetrig)

2. Degree Trigonometry, also known as "Find the angle simulator". Also incredibly inefficient. (dtrigonometry, degreetrig, dtrig)

3. Percentages (Multiplication by them, division with them, Value before Deduction, and Tax) (%, percentages, pcnt)
Once in percentages through one of the calls in the previous parentheses, the calls for the operations are (1,2,3,4) respectively. Only two numbers for the first two, but I'm working on that.

4. All 4 basic functions using only two numbers. (+,-,*,/) 

5. Finding the circumference and area of a circle accessed with (areacircle, ac, circumference, ccf)

6. Right triangle, trapezoid, and parallelogram areas and perimeters. (call sign unavailiable, being redone. Please attempt to not use these. However, if the temptation is so great, use 3d and 3D as the callsigns. It walks you through the rest.) 

7. Rectangular solid, Cube, Conic, Cylindrical, and Sphere properties (fullsolid, fs) 

That's about it. More features coming soon, such as actual coding.

Planned features: 

Quadratic equations 

Graphing (way down the line) 

Multiplication table output 


Thanks for reading! Enjoy!
